This is a very minimalistic compiler/emulator for the
Von-Neumann computer used in the hardware practice course
at the University of Technology Dresden (TUD).

If you do not know what this is for, you probably do not
need it.

In order to build the compiler and emulator, just type:

  make


Example usage:

  vnsasm -o multiply.bin examples/multiply.asm
  vnsem multiply.bin


Notes on the assembler:

The assembler is case insensitive.

* IN <port>

  Requests input for port <port> from user and stores it
  in the accumulator.

* OUT <port>

  Prints content of accumulator to stdout.

* .offset <offset>
  
  Sets address offset for the following code to <offset>.

  Example:

     JMP 0x10           ; jump to address 0x10
     .offset 0x10       ; set code offset to 0x10
     HLT                ; halt


* <label>:
  
  Declares a label.

  Example:

     JMP foo            ; jump to address labeled 'foo√Ñ
     foo2:              ; declare label 'foo2'
     RET                ; return
     foo: CALL foo2     ; declare label 'foo' and jump to
                        ; address labeled 'foo2'
     HLT                ; halt
