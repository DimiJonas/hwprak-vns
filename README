This is a very minimalistic compiler/emulator for the
Von-Neumann computer used in the hardware practice course
at the University of Technology Dresden (TUD).

If you do not know what this is for, you probably do not
need it.

Example usage:

  vnsasm -o intro.bin examples/intro.asm
  vnsem intro.bin
