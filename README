This is a very minimalistic compiler/emulator for the
Von-Neumann computer used in the hardware practice course
at the University of Technology Dresden (TUD).

If you do not know what this is for, you probably do not
need it.

In order to build the compiler and emulator, just type:

  make

Example usage:

  vnsasm -o multiply.bin examples/multiply.asm
  vnsem multiply.bin
